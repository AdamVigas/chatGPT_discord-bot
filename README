Discord Bot with OpenAI Integration

This project is a simple Discord bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate responses to user messages. The bot is built using the discord.py library and OpenAI's API.
Features

    Responds to messages in Discord channels using the GPT-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI.
    Handles rate limit errors and general OpenAI errors gracefully.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

    Python 3.8 or later installed on your machine.

    A Discord account and a Discord server where you have permission to add a bot.

    An OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up on the OpenAI website.

    The discord.py library and openai library installed. You can install them using pip:

    bash : pip install discord.py openai python-dotenv

Setup

    Clone the repository or download the bot's code.

    Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key:

    env

    DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

    Replace your-discord-bot-token and your-openai-api-key with your actual Discord bot token and OpenAI API key.

Usage

To run the bot, simply execute the bot.py script:

bash : python bot.py

The bot will connect to Discord and print a message to the console indicating it has logged in. The bot will respond to messages in any channel it has access to.
